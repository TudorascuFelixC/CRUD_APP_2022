# Tech

My crud application is using :


- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [php] - is a web-oriented general-purpose scripting language.
- [MongoDB] - MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database application that is open source. MongoDB is a NoSQL database application that works with JSON-like documents and optional schemas. i used MongoDB to create and use my database.
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework
- [Github] - virtual host where all the repository are pushed. [GitHub](https://github.com/TudorascuFelixC)
- [HTML] - the most used thing in the world
- [CSS] 

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
